Here are some changes:

**1. `http://example.com/not/a/local/path.js`**

```javascript
// This code block should be skipped because the path is a URL.
console.log("Skipped code 1");
```

And another invalid one:

**2. `C:\absolute\path\on\windows.txt`**

```text
# This code block should also be skipped due to absolute path.
Skipped content 2
```

Now a valid one to ensure parsing continues:

**3. `src/valid-component.jsx`**

```jsx
// This should be parsed correctly.
import React from 'react';

function ValidComponent() {
  return <div>Valid</div>;
}

export default ValidComponent;
```

One more without a path:

```text
This block has no path and should trigger a warning.
```
